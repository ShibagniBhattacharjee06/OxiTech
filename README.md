Problem Statement
Access to reliable and efficient emergency ventilators is a major challenge in both medical crises and extreme environments.
Overburdened hospitals struggle to provide life-saving ventilation due to equipment shortages, particularly during pandemics
like COVID-19. Additionally, mountaineers and high-altitude trekkers frequently suffer from oxygen deprivation, leading to 
life-threatening conditions such as hypoxia. The lack of a portable, rapidly deployable, and adaptive ventilation system worsens
these issues. There is a pressing need for a smart, energy-efficient, and mobile solution that ensures uninterrupted oxygen support 
wherever it is needed.

A Good Idea: OxiTech
OxiTech is a revolutionary emergency ventilator designed to provide life-saving respiratory support in hospitals, disaster zones, and
high-altitude environments. Unlike traditional ventilators, OxiTech is portable, intelligent, and adaptive, making it ideal for critical 
situations where conventional equipment is impractical.
